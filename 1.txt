Of course! I'd be happy to guide you through the complete workflow, from running your project locally in VS Code to deploying it for the world to see on Vercel. It's a standard and powerful process for modern web development.
Here is a step-by-step guide.
Part 1: Running the Project Locally in VS Code
Your project is currently set up as a collection of static files (HTML, CSS from a CDN, and JavaScript modules) without a complex build system. The easiest way to run this locally is with a live server that can handle an index.html file.
Prerequisite: Install VS Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code.
Install the "Live Server" Extension:
Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon on the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for "Live Server" (the one by Ritwick Dey is the most popular).
Click "Install".
Open Your Project Folder:
In VS Code, go to File > Open Folder... and select the directory containing your index.html, App.tsx, etc.
Handle the API Key for Local Testing:
Your code in services/geminiService.ts uses process.env.API_KEY. A simple live server cannot access environment variables.
For local testing only, you can temporarily modify services/geminiService.ts.
Find this line:
Generated typescript
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY as string });
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Temporarily replace it with your actual key:
Generated typescript
// !! FOR LOCAL TESTING ONLY - DO NOT COMMIT TO GITHUB !!
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" });
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
⚠️ IMPORTANT: We will set this up securely in Vercel later. Do not ever commit your API key directly into your code on GitHub.
Start the Server:
In the VS Code file explorer, right-click on your index.html file.
Select "Open with Live Server".
A new browser tab will open at an address like http://127.0.0.1:5500, and you'll see your application running! It will automatically refresh whenever you save a file.
Part 2: Pushing Your Code to GitHub
Version control is essential. This process will store your code on GitHub, creating a backup and a central place for Vercel to access it.
Prerequisites:
Create a GitHub account.
Install Git on your computer.
Create a New Repository on GitHub:
Log in to GitHub.
Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
Give your repository a name (e.g., rakhi-store-project).
Choose if you want it to be Public or Private.
Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license, since you already have files.
Click "Create repository".
Initialize Git in Your Project Folder:
Open a terminal or command prompt inside your project folder in VS Code (View > Terminal or `Ctrl+``).
Run the following commands one by one:
Generated bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init -b main

# Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
# (This is a good practice for all projects)
echo "node_modules\n.env" > .gitignore

# Add all your files to be tracked by Git
git add .

# Create your first "save point" or commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of RakhiStore project"

# Connect your local folder to the GitHub repository you created
# (Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL from your new GitHub repo page)
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Use code with caution.
Bash
After you run git push, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all your files there!
Part 3: Deploying to Vercel
Vercel is a platform that makes deploying frontend applications incredibly simple, especially when they're on GitHub.
Sign Up for Vercel:
Go to vercel.com and click "Sign Up".
It's highly recommended to sign up with your GitHub account. This makes the integration seamless.
Import and Deploy Your Project:
Once you're logged into your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project".
Vercel will show a list of your GitHub repositories. Find your rakhi-store-project and click "Import".
Configure the Project:
Vercel is smart, but your project is unique. You'll need to configure it correctly.
Framework Preset: Vercel might not recognize a framework. Select "Other".
Build and Output Settings: Your project doesn't have a build step (like npm run build).
Toggle the "Build Command" switch to override it, and leave the field blank.
Toggle the "Output Directory" switch and ensure it's set to the root directory (it usually is by default, or you can just leave it).
Environment Variables: This is the most critical step for making your app work online!
Expand the "Environment Variables" section.
For the NAME, enter API_KEY.
For the VALUE, paste your actual Google Gemini API Key.
Click "Add". This securely stores your key so your deployed app can use it without exposing it in the code.
Deploy!
Click the "Deploy" button.
Vercel will start the deployment process (which will be very fast for a static site). Within a minute, you'll see a "Congratulations!" message with a screenshot of your live site.
You're all set! Vercel will give you a public URL (like your-project-name.vercel.app) where you can see your live RakhiStore. Now, whenever you git push new changes to your main branch on GitHub, Vercel will automatically redeploy your site with the updates.
